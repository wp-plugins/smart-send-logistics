Pickup table rate shipping methods for WooCommerce. Pickup locations for Post Danmark, GLS, SwipBox and Bring. Allow for easy and cheap delivery.

== Description ==

Smart Send provides a great module for customers to choose a delivery point, directly from the checkout page.

The delivery points are listed by distance from the shipping information provided, such that the nearest delivery point will always be at the top of the list.

It's free to try for 30 days. Sign up on: [SmartSend.dk](http://smartsend.dk)

You can use delivery points provided from multiple carriers, like
*   Post Danmark - Pacsoft Online
*   GLS - YourGLS
*   SwipBox
*   Bring - MyBring

The list of delivery points are provided online from the carriers API. Your customers will therefore always see the newest list of delivery points on the checkout page.
